### 🛠️ My Journey: From Hardware to Software

My passion for creating started young and has evolved through different mediums. I believe in turning ideas into tangible, working products.

* **The Spark (Childhood):** Started with **Lego**, moved to intricate paper crafts, and then to building functional **cardboard guns** that could actually shoot.
* **The Maker (Early Teens):** Taught myself woodworking and then dove into **electronics**.
* **The Innovator (High School):** Shifted to complex hardware, robotics, and software, which became my core focus.
* **Today:** My focus is on **Software Engineering, AI/ML, and Fintech** to solve complex problems at scale.

### 💡 Hardware, Robotics & Early Projects

* **Text-to-Braille Converter (🏆 Inspire Award Winner):** My first major project in 8th grade. This device converted text to Braille in real-time using ASCII and 6 solenoids. It received a **10,000 INR grant** from the government's Inspire Awards.
* **Mars Rover (Atal Lab Team):** As a core member of my school's Atal Lab team, we designed and built a Mars rover prototype complete with bionic arms and sample collection features.
* **Firefighter's Thermal Mask (Atal Lab Team):** We developed a mask integrated with a thermal imagery camera to help firefighters see through dense smoke.
* **Sign Language to Text Gloves (Atal Lab Team):** A glove-based system using motion detectors to translate sign language into text, breaking communication barriers.
* **Homemade Hoverboard (Atal Lab Team):** A simple, functional hoverboard prototype.
